Advanced Programming Techniques SP2 2024

Assignment 1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Milestone 1: *Complete* ~21/06/2024

Test ranged from simple 1 turn to multiple branches.
Test generation completed without issues.

Encountered Bugs: 
None

Additional Comments: 
NA

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Milestone 2: *Complete* ~24/06/2024

Function to load sample test env to 2D Array.
Additional variables and functions created in associated class files.
Function to iterate through the maze and check for valid pathways
completed.

Encountered Bugs: 
Some errors in coding particular values when searching directions 
kept breaking the app. 
Mostly user error due to 'copy and pasting' code and not validating.
e.g. search up -> (row-1)(col)... being copied and used for search 
left which is suppose to be (row)(col-1). 

Compiled and executed fine. Error only discovered when using console 
output code to generate values during testing.

Additional Comments:
Had to revisit code examples and the A1 search algorithm video quite 
a few times. Still some issues grasping basic concept of using * and &.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Milestone 3: *Complete* ~25/06/2024

Function to iterate through NodeExplored list and check against loaded 
maze for shortest path.
Function to generate pathway directional arrows to output a solution 

Encountered Bugs:
Early attempts to solution a working algorithm failed.
First attempt involved going from the end of the NodeExplored list 
and looking for a connecting block from the same list prior to checking 
against the loaded env. This created errors and broke the app by 
generating an endless loop.

Second attempt involved a method similar to Milestone 2 and generating 
a list then comparing the results to NodeExplored. This was abandoned 
as the process got out of hand and too overly bloated.

Final attempt used lengthy if statements. Result achieved however, I do 
wonder if there's an easier way then using long if and/or statements

Outputting solution ran into some issues with outputting the correct 
turn arrow.
Resolved it by running the output generation backwards 

Additional Comments:

This milestone was significantly more challenging than Milestone 2, 
however the challenge was quite satisfying to overcome. Having started
over a few times with attempts gave me a chance to grasp the usage 
of * and & a little better.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Milestone 4: *Incomplete*

This milestone was not attempted due to lack of time due to study 
commitments from 2 other courses. Will definitely try
it in my spare time though.
